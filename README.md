# Human Fall Detection System

## Overview
The Human Fall Detection System leverages cutting-edge machine learning to provide real-time detection of falls, enhancing safety for elderly and high-risk individuals. By using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), this system offers a proactive solution to quickly respond to potential accidents, reducing the risk of serious injuries.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilizes continuous video surveillance to detect falls as they happen.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs advanced CNN models trained on diverse datasets to ensure precise detection with minimal false alarms.
- **Automated Alerts**: Generates instant notifications to caregivers or emergency services, facilitating swift action.
- **Ease of Integration**: Designed to seamlessly fit into existing camera systems and infrastructure.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensures strict adherence to privacy standards, processing all data locally.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
